# Microsoft Access Database â€“ Customer & Installation Tracking

This project includes two Microsoft Access database files created through textbook-based tutorial labs. It simulates a customer and installation tracking system for a fictional drainage company, focusing on basic data structure, relationship design, queries, forms, and reports.

##  Files

- `Lab4_Final.accdb`: Covers Tutorials 1â€“4  
  Includes tables, relationships, basic forms, and field property customizations.

- `Lab8_Final.accdb`: Covers Tutorials 5â€“8  
  Adds filtered queries, grouped reports, export functionality, and refined layout.

  **Additional modules from the textbook (Tutorials 9 and beyond) will be added in future updates.**

## ðŸ“˜ Based on Class Practice 2 â€“ Tutorials 1â€“8 from Course Textbook

The two database files were created as part of **Class Practice 2**, a cumulative hands-on project based on Tutorials 1â€“8 from the official course textbook.  
Each part is based on tutorial case problems from the following textbook:
